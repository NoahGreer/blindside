                A further 20 of the convertible Roadster went for a dizzying $2.2 million,
                but even these were a comparative snip versus the track-only,

                <p> Exotic cats range in price from a $900.00 Bobcat to a $7500.00 tiger cub.
                Most of the mid size cats, like Servals and
                Caracals cost $1700.00 to $2800.00 and Ocelots can run as high as $15,000.00.
                The more rare the cat, the higher the price.</p>

                One of the highlights of the Boeing 757 is a glass cockpit with large computer screens that display flight info.
                It has a self-checking feature that alerts pilots about issues before they bloom into emergencies.
                Trump’s plane is one of the fastest in the world and can hit more than 500 miles per hour powered by two
                Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engines that can keep it afloat for 16 hours.
                A regular Boeing 757 can seat up to 200 people, but Trump has refurbished his plane to accommodate only 23 passengers.
                Apart from the two bedrooms, it has a private guest room, dining room, and a video room with cinema system.
                Trump pays a lavish price for these amenities and shells out about $10,800 for a one-hour flight including fuel.

                Like many billionaire families, Ambanis too wanted an opulently unique and customized residence.
                Thus began the conceptualization and construction of ‘Antilia’, designed by the firm Perkins and Will,
                named after a mythical island in the Atlantic Ocean. Costing over $1 billion and taking four-years to be constructed,
                Antilia now stands boastingly, amidst the slum-filled context of Mumbai. This 27-floor high residence,
                stacked to achieve an area of about 400,000 square feet, surpasses the Palace of Versailles in terms of area encompassed.
                With six levels of parking below the ground level, three helipads, a health spa, a salon, a ballroom,
                a 50-seat movie theater, multiple swimming pools, yoga and dance studios
                and an ice cream room, maintaining Antilia reportedly require a staff of about 600.
